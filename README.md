# DataVizHw
HW4:
Use d3 v4 for all problems in Distributions and histograms; HSLa color

HW5:
Create the Maps and linear models: two choropleth maps, showing gun ownership and population density for each US state. 

HW7:
The accompanying figure is from Colin Ware's book Visual Thinking for Design. It contains 8 visual features that have been found to trigger pre-attentive processing in your visual cortex. Replicate them in SVG using d3. At least one animated: blinking, different direction, or different phase. For the blinking animation, change one or more HSL features, do not make radiating lines. For the two that show motion, use circles moving in the way suggested by the arrows, not literal arrows.
Use a collision-avoiding force layout the random positions.
